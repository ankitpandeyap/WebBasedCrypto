🔐 WebBasedCrypto
-

A secure full-stack web application for encrypted messaging, built with Spring Boot and React.js. It offers symmetric encryption, secure key exchange, JWT-based authentication, and OTP verification, ensuring confidential communication between users.

🚀 Features
-

🔑 OTP Verification: Email-based OTP during user registration for enhanced security.

🛡️ JWT Authentication: Secure login with access and refresh tokens.

♻️ Token Refresh: Endpoint to refresh tokens with auto-blacklisting of expired ones.

🚪 Secure Logout: Invalidates tokens and clears security context.

👥 Role-Based Access Control: Fine-grained access using annotations.

📧 SMTP Integration: For sending OTPs via email.

🗃️ Redis Integration: Handles session and token management.

🧱 Symmetric Encryption: Secure message encryption and decryption.

🖥️ React Frontend: Protected routes, toast notifications, and authentication context.

⚡ Real-time Messaging: Instant message delivery and status updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Redis Pub/Sub.

📦 Prerequisites
-

Java JDK 17+

Maven 3.8+

MySQL (local or Docker)

Docker (for Redis)

Node.js & npm (for frontend)



🐳 Redis Setup with Docker
-

docker run --name redis-crypto -p 6379:6379 -d redis



📧 SMTP Setup for OTP Delivery
-

Update your application.properties:

spring.mail.host=smtp.mail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your-email@mail.com
spring.mail.password=your-app-password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true



⚙️ Core Configuration
-

# Redis Configuration
redis.host=localhost
redis.port=6379

# CORS Configuration
cors.allowed.origins=http://localhost:3000
cors.allowed.methods=GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,PATCH
cors.allowed.headers=*
cors.allowed.credentials=true

🧱 Module Structure
-

Backend: config, filters, security, service, controller, repository, entity, utils

Frontend (React.js):

/pages: Login, Register, Dashboard, ComposeMessage, SentMessages, ProfilePage

/components: Header, Footer, ProtectedRoute, LoadingSpinner, DecryptModal, Sidebar

/context: AuthContext (Manages authentication state and JWTs), SseContext (Manages SSE connection and real-time updates)

App.jsx: Routing setup with conditional footer and toast messages

🔐 Authentication Flow
-

Register: User registers and receives an OTP via email.

OTP Verification: User enters OTP to verify email.

Login: User logs in and receives access & refresh tokens.

Token Validation: JWTs are validated via filters.

Token Refresh: New access token issued using refresh token.

Logout: Tokens are blacklisted via Redis and security context is cleared.

🧾 Token Filters
-

JWTAuthenticationFilter: Handles user login and initial token generation.

JWTValidationFilter: Validates the access token for incoming requests.

JWTRefreshFilter: Manages refresh token logic, issuing new access tokens.

All filters check Redis for blacklisted tokens.

🔒 Role-Based Authorization
-

Use annotations in controllers, for example:

@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/admin/data")
public ResponseEntity<?> getAdminData() {
    // Only accessible by admin role
}

🚀 Production-Ready Practices
-

🔐 HTTPS Support: To be added during deployment.

🔑 Secrets Management: Move DB, mail, JWT secrets to environment variables or a secrets manager.

🔒 Secure Redis: Protect Redis with a password if exposed externally.

🌐 CORS Restrictions: Restrict CORS to production domains.

📊 Logging: Implement SLF4J + Logback for comprehensive logging.

🛡️ Token Revocation: Use Redis TTLs for efficient cleanup of blacklisted tokens.

🌐 React Frontend Highlights
-

AuthContext: Manages authentication state with localStorage persistence.

Protected Routes: Ensures only authenticated users can access certain pages.

Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts.

Toast Notifications: Provides feedback for login, messages, real-time events.

Conditional Footer: Footer displayed only on the login page.

SseContext: Manages SSE for real-time updates with reconnect and auth.

Dynamic Message Display: Dashboard merges API + SSE messages intelligently.

⚡ Real-time Messaging with SSE & Redis Pub/Sub
-

How it Works:

Client SSE Subscription (SseContext.jsx): React frontend connects to /api/messages/stream after login. Authenticated with JWT. Includes heartbeat and reconnection logic.

Message Sending & Redis Publish (MessageServiceImpl): Backend encrypts, stores, and publishes messages to Redis.

Redis Subscribe & SSE Push (RedisSubscriberImpl): Subscribes to Redis channel and pushes new messages to SSE clients.

Frontend Message Handling (Dashboard.jsx): Merges SSE updates with fetched messages, providing real-time UI updates.

Benefits:
_______________________________________________________
Instantaneity: No delay in delivering new messages.

Efficiency: Persistent SSE reduces server load vs polling.

Scalability: Redis Pub/Sub supports scaling across instances.

Simplified Client Logic: SSE is simpler than WebSockets for one-way comms.

Robustness: Heartbeats, retries, and token refresh built-in.

Key Components in Code:

Backend:
_________________________________________

MessageSseController: SSE stream endpoint

SseEmitterService: Manages emitter lifecycles and sends events

MessageServiceImpl: Encrypts, stores, and publishes message

RedisSubscriberImpl: Listens to Redis and pushes via SSE

Frontend:
___________________________

SseContext.jsx: Manages EventSource, handles events, reconnects

AuthContext.jsx: Provides JWT and refresh logic

Dashboard.jsx: Renders real-time inbox with merged state
